TAPAS - Tool for rApid Prototyping of Adaptive Streaming algorithms
====================================================================

TAPAS is a tool that allows rapid prototyping and experimental evaluation of Adaptive Streaming control algorithms.
If you are a developer and you want to design and test a new Adaptive Streaming control algorithm
you should check the documentation placed in the doc/ directory.

If you are a user and you want to experiment with the control algorithms made available
by TAPAS you can follow the instructions given below. 

Today, TAPAS implement a "conventional" adpative streaming controller as described in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.0510.pdf) 

Of course, we urge developers and researchers to send us their controllers so we can add them 
to TAPAS. In this way reproducible experimental comparisons between different algorithm can be 
made by using the same tool.

Installation
------------
TAPAS has been tested to work on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 14.10. If you use TAPAS on other distributions
please let us know.

Ubuntu does not ship gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg package since 14.04 LTS, you need to add a repository with
the following commands.

For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 
 
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
    sudo apt-get update

For Ubuntu 14.10: 

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/gstffmpeg-keep
    sudo apt-get update
    
All the required dependencies are listed below: 

    sudo apt-get install python-twisted python-twisted-bin python-twisted-core python-twisted-web \
        gstreamer0.10-plugins-* gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-tools python-gst0.1 libgstreamer0.10-dev \
        python-scipy python-psutil

Usage
-----

Play a default playlist: 
    
    $ python play.py

Play a default playlist with a "conventional" adaptive controller: 
    
    $ python play.py -a conventional

Play a playlist specified by its URL: 

    $ python play.py -u http://mysite.com/myplaylist.m3u8

Play a sample MPEG-DASH video: 
    
    $ python play.py -u http://yt-dash-mse-test.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/media/car-20120827-manifest.mpd
 
Play a playlist for logs, without decoding video: 

	$ python play.py -m nodec

Play a playlist with a fake player (emulated playout buffer and no decoding): 

	$ python play.py -m fake

Play only the highest quality of the playlist: 

	$ python play.py -a max

Player options: ::

	$ python play.py --help

Enable debug mode: 
    
    $ DEBUG=2 python play.py
